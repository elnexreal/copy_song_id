# Copy Song ID

Are you tired of remembering the song ID you heard in a level to use it yourself?
Are you tired of writing the song ID manually every time you want to send it to a friend? **WELL... NO MORE!**

With the Copy Song ID mod you just need to click the song id `it's in green color if you can't figure out lmao` and it will be automatically copied to your clipboard.

## Notes

- This only works for the first song of a level `(if the level has more than one song you still need to copy the ID manually)`
- The mod changes the UI a little bit to fit the new way of displaying the ID and the SFX's.
- Bugs should be reported in my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/vfFazvmKKb) or in the mod's GitHub repository.

## Credits

- Thx atreusarg (juako para los compas) for the idea.
